# Motherload2CraftingEngine
A functioning system for smelting and refining materials into other materials to be used for uppgrades and selling.
This repository works as a base for a crafting system with the option to expand and change. I will personally use it to try to implement it (with some modifications) in a game I'm building 
on the Contruct 3 engine. 

As the example set in the main.js and the utilities.test.js you can add/remove Items from an inventory that is global. You can then use theese items and craft them into new ones. The idea is to have a smelter and factory as different buildings with different items to craft.
